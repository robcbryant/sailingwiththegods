0@UpgradeShip@-1@Goatherd Jason, your fortunes are about to change! You are a young man of better birth than fortunes: you belong in the palace as a prince but alas, you get your living schlepping from one port to another, doing petty trade and hoping for some random fish. You now sail on the tiny ship Kyrenia, and have five crew now but can hire up to ten men. Read their descriptions on the Available Crew page: do you want to hire muscle-bound heroically minded hulks, sailors who know the sea, seers who know the minds of the gods? To join the quest to win the game, you have to buy a trireme from the shipyard: time for you to earn some drachma!@None@void@-1@1_2_3_4_5_6_7_8_9_10_11_12_13_14_15_16_17_18_20_21_22_23_24_25_26_27_28@-1@@@
1@City@309@You have your trireme and a crew of heroes: the Mediterranean is hot, you’d better buy water or they’ll quit! If you’re going to act like an Argonaut, you need to begin your quest at Pagasae. Evil King Pelias will send you on a crazy impossible (?) quest to retrieve the golden fleece, taking you through a specific series of stops. You can follow this quest to win the game. Or you can win by getting rich, beating pirates, and making monuments to yourself. Your progress in either case is traced through your clout – see the cloutometer beneath your icon. If you want to follow the quest, head to Pagasae! Go to the tavern if you want to hire a navigator.@Message@You are at Pagasae: you make a big impression! You’re good looking and your ship is (literally) divine: Athena made it, and put in an oracular piece of timber from Dodona, where the gods spoke through the winds in the leaves. Better make the gods happy: you make a sacrifice, have a feast, and sing as song as you set off, led by Orpheus who could sing magical tunes. Herakles was voted captain, but he declined: who could do this better than you?

2@City@388@Find your way to the tomb of Dolops – a mighty hero of an ancient time, who will mess with the winds and the waves until you give him proper ritual attention. As you go, you’ll pass the looming headland of Tisaia, and the lofty crags of Mount Pelion, home of the centaur Chiron. The island of Skiathos is to the east: resist the beaches and focus on Dolops. If you get lost, better ask directions, either in a tavern or from your crew, whom you have not yet dehydrated, right?@Message@Here lies Dolops! He was a son of Hermes, as tricky as his father but much less immortal. That trickiness, for you, means he stirred up nasty storms until you entertained him with two days of barbecue and athletic competition (Superbowl for Dolops?) When you leave, you are so excited to be off, and no longer entertaining a corpse, that you rename the place ‘Departure of the Argo.’ Don’t forget to check the captain’s log for directions!@386_319_366@-1@-1@stop_2.jpg@“Intaglio with a Scene of Sacrifice” / Source © Michael C.

3@City@67@Go to Lemnos, home of frighteningly strong but very smelly women (the curse of Aphrodite), who killed their husbands and are now Very Lonely. As you sail, contemplating the risks of dating enroute, you may glimpse the hills of Pallene, the cape of Canastra, or the peaks of Mount Athos, sacred to Zeus, where the entire fleet of the Persian King Darius shipwrecked on the way to losing the battle of Marathon in 491 BC.@Message@You’ve arrived at Lemnos and the women all lie to you about having killed their husbands; your crew all find girlfriends, and you take up with Hypsipyle herself, the queen of the island. Herakles gets very impatient with all the long delay and finally shames you back to your oars. You set sail, breaking hearts but well stocked with supplies; you will have lasting welcome and friendship with the people of this island. Your next stop: the mystic island of Samothrace!@310_168_152@-1@-1@stop_3.jpg@“Adieux de Jason à Hypsipyle (Epîtres d’Ovide, Octavien de Saint Gelais)” / Source gallica.bnf.fr / Bibliothèque nationale de France@https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b55013427h/f98
4@City@1@Find your way to Samothrace! Head straight northeast: the island is the tallest mountain peak of the Aegean, nicknamed ‘shining in the moon’ and ‘the bright white one’ for its high visibility. Sacred to the island is the pompilos or guide fish: with any luck, one will appear and lead your ship on its way.@Message@You have arrived at Samothrace: people from all around the Mediterranean came here to be initiated into the secret rites of the Great Gods of the island, for a modest fee which you may also pay! Once initiated you will have the protection of the gods for your ship, and a network of friends from the Black Sea to the delta of Egypt; you may return to observe the island’s festivals, where the history of the island was told in drama and dance.@1@-1@-1@stop_4.jpg@“Carola delle Muse.” Epigraphical and archaeological collections including copies of drawings by Ciriaco d'Ancona ('Codex Ashmolensis').

5@City@197@Find your way to Cyzicus! What a long tricky trek lies ahead of you, passing the shores of Thrace, full of wild gods and wildly successful businessmen; Imbros lies to your southwest, where more mystery cults were celebrated (maybe like Samothrace, who can tell?). The Hellespont is a famously difficult strait, and you must pass through it!@Message@You have arrived at Cyzicus, home of a friendly king and unfriendly earthborn monsters: each one has six arms springing from his body. Herakles, ever uber-manly, bashes them into submission for you with ease; you and Cyzicus become BFF’s, and you set sail from here full of good wishes. But the gods have other plans: a storm drives you back to port, and in the darkness the Cyzicenes attack you; you yourself accidentally kill the king! The result is great mourning, and another horrible storm. The gods finally intervene, and send a bird of the sea to your seer Mopsos; the bird tweets instructions for a powerful ritual that will appease the wrath of nature. You fulfill the instructions to the letter, performing war dances and humble sacrifice on the peak of Cyzicus’ mount Dindymum, overlooking the waves. In the morning the winds are calm, the sea is clear, and you row away, humbled by the power of the gods and the need for a good solid seer. Where to now?

6@City@289@Find your way to Mysia, full of vegetarians and friends of the city of Troy! Rhyndakos will be on your south; here the Greeks of Miletus will found a colony, led by Apollo. You’ll find Mysia by way of the mouth of the Kios river. Do you need to ask directions? Ask the crew, or go to a local tavern.@Message@You have arrived at Mysia! You thank Apollo of Happy Landings, and find that the locals are friendly. Herakles sends his beloved and extremely good looking companion Hylas to fetch water – and here, good looks mean bad luck. The local nymphs fall in love with him, and drag him into their spring to keep for their own. Herakles is mad with rage, and with his comrade Polyphemus dashes around the country to find him. The ship sets sail without them. Once you realize this, you are about to turn back. Glaukos the sea god emerges from the waves to tell you this is destiny: Hylas must marry the nymph, Herakles must get after his twelve labors, and Polyphemus must found a great city in Mysia.@346_256@-1@14_11_27@stop_6.jpg@“Hylas and the Nymphs” by John William Waterhouse 1896@https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waterhouse_Hylas_and_the_Nymphs_Manchester_Art_Gallery_1896.15.jpg
7@City@156@Make your way to Bebrycia! Here the kings are rumored to be descended from Poseidon, possibly from mating with the daughter of Danaus, a mythical king of Libya and Arabia. If you see the Gulf of Olbia, you’re heading into a maritime cul-de-sac, so turn around!! Sail west toward the setting sun.@Message@You have arrived at Bebrycia – dangers await! King Amycus has a violent streak: he kills foreigners, either by sacrificing them to Poseidon or beating them to death in a boxing match. He cheats: he inserts weighted, spiked metal bits into the leather he uses to wrap his hands, called himantes. Thankfully you have Polydeukes, the great Greek boxer on board, so Amycus meets his bloody match. After Polydeukes kills the king in the boxing ring, you and all your crew get into a battle with his people, - you win with no losses, hold a big feast and set sail for Thynia.@227@-1@-1@stop_7.jpg@“Boxers” in Hieronymi Mercvrialis De arte gymnastica libri sex by Girolamo Mercuriale / Source archive.org contributor Getty Resesarch Institute@https://archive.org/details/mercvrialisdeart00merc/page/112
8@City@384@Heading to Thynia, you must direct yourself toward the rising sun in the east; your route will demand passage through a treacherously narrow strait. The entrance lies between Byzantion and Chalcedon. Both cities were settled by the Greeks of Megara; they chose Chalcedon first, which was so much less promising a site that the Persian Megabazos called Chalcedon ‘the city of the blind.’@Message@You have arrived at Hieron, a vital site in Thynia. In historical times, this was the place to celebrate Zeus of the Winds; for the Argonauts, you need to beware the Harpies, the hounds of Zeus! They are women, they are wind, they are violent and they are half-birds. And, they are hungry. And, they smell awful. They punish Phineus, a seer who angered Zeus by giving prophecies that were too accurate; the Harpies snatch his food from his table and befoul what they cannot take. You free the sad old man with the help of Zetes and Calais, two sons of the North Wind who are among your crew: they engage in the first airborne battle in history, driving the Harpies far, far away to the Floating Islands, which were imagined to be in Crete, Sicily or beyond. Here they lock the windy birdwomen underground, and return to their rejoicing buddies. Phineus tells everyone how to get to the Black Sea: you must pass through the clashing rocks. To do this, release a trembling dove and see if she makes it; if the dove survives the rocks, you should follow! If not, go back.@162@-1@-1@stop_8.jpg@“The Harpies Driven from the Table of King Phineus by Zetes and Calais” by Francois Verdier / Source The Metropolitan Museum of Art CC-PA@https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/339797

10@City@385@Congratulations! You are not squashed by the rocks and the Black Sea stretches out before you: you are the first Greeks to ever sail into these waters. Turn east toward the desert island named Thynias, a barren rock with a shining god. Turn your prow toward the rising sun and coast along the beaches until you pass Rebas and Kolone, if you hit Sangarius you’ve gone too far@Message@You have arrived at Thynias! This is a dry and unpromising desert island but Apollo himself appears to you, riding his chariot across the sky. He is the god who best knows how to bring Greeks to places they had never been. Celebrate him! You build him an altar, celebrating him as Lord of the Dawn; your men dance, pour libations and sing. You spend three days celebrating, and then sail to the Cape of Acherusias.@342_256@-1@-1@stop_10.jpg@“Table top depicting Aurora and the Chariot of Apollo” 1822 by Gioacchino Barberi / Source The Metropolitan Museum of Art CC-PA@https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/696311
11@City@169@Continue east to Acherusia! You’ll pass the mouth of the River Sangarius; ahead of you looms the headland of Acherusia, where a gloomy chill, a darker sky, and a path to the underworld await you. Here the Acheron river tumbles into daylight, rising from the underworld. Smooth rocks and pounding sea lie below; a wide-spreading plane tree grows on the highest point of the promontory, an easy point for sailors to steer by. Also a pretty scary point for sailors to steer by.@Message@You arrive at Acherusia, the land of Mariandyni, ruled by good king Lycus. Herakles helped his family long ago, and he welcomes you as his friends. He is most impressed that you beat Amycus to death, which seems to him a fine recommendation for sending his own son, Dasyclus, with you on your journey. But enough good news: Idmon the seer meets his end here, gored by a white tusked boar: he had foreseen his death, one of the benefits of being a seer after all. You bury him in a great tomb just beneath the headland: his tomb will guide ships on their way just as he guided you. You then lose Tiphys your helmsman, who would read the stars and guide your way: a swift sickness took him to Hades. You bury him alongside Idmon and appoint Ancaeus to take his place. You head for Lyra.@359@30@16_29@stop_11.jpg@“Vessel in the Shape of a Wild Boar” from the Cleveland Museum of Art / Source Wikimedia CC0 1.0@https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Clevelandart_1977.42.jpg
12@City@274@Sail to Lyra! Enroute you must pass the river Callichorus, Place of Pretty Dances: pretty, but pretty intense! It was Dionysos who taught the nymphs to dance here, in all-night celebrations of solemn mysteries and great intensity. You’d best keep moving….@Message@You have reached Lyra! And once again an ancient hero rises from the tomb to demand attention from you: he cannot stay underground, given the chance to gaze on you (you remind him so much of, well, himself…..). This is Sthenelaos, who was killed while accompanying Herakles on his quest to steal the belt of the Amazon queen. That belt is a metaphor for all her power – and Sthenelaos lost all of his, meeting his doom in the quest. Herakles himself built the tomb for his friend; Mopsos the seer tells you to approach the tomb, offer Sthenelaos some libations, and build an altar to Apollo who Saves our Ships. Orpheus offered his lyre as a gift to the god, and the name ‘Lyre’ to the place he left it. The next morning you head out for Sinope.@349@-1@-1@stop_12.jpg@“Column-Krater Depicting Orpheus among the Thracians” from the Carlos Museum / Source © Michael C. Carlos Museum, Emory Unversity.

13@City@445@Look for Sinope, in the land of Assyria! You must pass the stream of Parthenius as it flows into the sea: Parthenius was the child of Ocean and Tethys, among the holy rivers of the ancient world (Hesiod Theogony 337). An archaic poet describes this river as flowing ‘as softly as a dainty maiden goes. Then you’ll pass Sesamus and Cromna, and finally you’ll pass around Carambis on your way.@Message@You have reached Sinope in the Assyrian land. The place is named for Sinope, a lovely Naiad of the Pontus, who caught Zeus’s eye (admit it, pretty much everyone did). The city was famous historically as the home of Diogenes, the great Cynic philosopher. That cynicism could have started with Zeus. He was desperate to sleep with Sinope, and promised her anything she wanted in return: she responded that she wanted her virginity. She ultimately tricked two other gods, Halys and Apollo, the same way. Here you encounter more detritus from Herakles’ Amazonian quest: three men, Delion, Autolykos and Phlogius greet you with delight.

You’ll pass the River Halys on your way.@Message@You have arrived at the icy cold Thermodon River. The Amazons dwell here: they are powerful women who have no fondness for the Greeks! Some say they descended from the Scythians and Sarmatians; others that they were the daughters of Ares, god of war, and the nymph Harmonia. See the image of their city in flames as they battle Theseus’ Athenians (Hdt. 4.110) – happily enough you don’t have to fight them.

The winds carry you, but your men must also row to ensure safe arrival.@Message@You have come to the island of Ares – here the Amazons worship the war god who may be their father, but certainly is as deadly as can be. Even the birds are scary here. They shoot feathers like arrows! Shooting back is useful, but you and your men frighten them by clanging your spears and shields together: they can’t stand the racket and fly away. Here you meet the sons of Phrixus. Phrixus, when just a little boy, was to be sacrificed along with his sister Helle, because of the machinations of his evil stepmother Ino. Their mother Nephele, a cloud nymph, wouldn’t let this happen, and sent a flying golden ram to save them. Helle fell off and drowned in the waters now called the Hellespont; Phrixus made it all the way to Colchis where he sacrificed the ram to Zeus, settled down, got married, and had some baby heroes. Its fleece is now your goal!@-1@31@-1@stop_15.jpg@“The Legend of Phrixus and Helles” by Dylazuna / Source Deviant Art, image copyright Dylazuna all rights reserved@https://www.deviantart.com/dylazuna/art/Aries-The-Legend-of-Phrixus-and-Helle-384864786
16@City@402@Look for the Phasis river! Head toward the steep crags of the Caucasus mountains; here Prometheus was chained in agony, while the eagle of Zeus ripped out his liver every day (and it grew back at night for the next day of torture). You’ll see the city of Aea nearby – this is the capital of Colchis. Greeks believed it was a very ancient place: Herodotus (2.104) claims the local people descended from the Egyptians of the army of Pharaoh Sesostris, from whom they learned the art of circumcision.@Quiz@golden_fleece@173_123@-1@-1@stop_16.jpg@“De Medee a Iason (Epîtres d’Ovide, Octavien de Saint Gelais)” Source gallica.bnf.fr / Bibliothèque nationale de France@https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b55013427h/f194.item

The Paphlagonians had a frightful reputation in the ancient Greek world: they were both stupid and prone to war, smelled of garlic and were superstitious by nature.@Message@Medea has ordered you to put in at Paphlagonia, in order to perform rites thanking Hekate for her aid in the quest: you would never have succeeded without her! You follow Medea’s instructions: Hekate is a frightful goddess, and her rites are unspeakable.

The Colchians are in hot pursuit!@Message@You arrive at one of the two islands of Bryges, sacred to Artemis. Here you encounter Apsyrtus, the son of Aeetes and brother of Medea, who pursued and overtook you. With the Colchians so close, the Argonauts consider abandoning her to her angry countrymen. She threatens Jason with her furies if he does so – and instead agrees to lure her brother to his death. They pretend they seek a diplomatic negotiation, and offer him the cloak of Hypsipyle; Jason slaughters the boy, cuts off his extremities, sucks out and then spits out the blood. This kind of practice – maschalismos – was known among Mediterranean pirates; it seems to have weakened the body the dead to keep them from returning for revenge.@252@-1@-1@stop_default.jpg@“The Argonauts landing at the Tomb of Dolops” / Source Ye gods and little fishes, 1900.

If you see the Peloponnesus, you have not gone far enough to the east.@Message@Once you reach Crete, you meet a new challenge: the island is guarded by Talos, a giant man of bronze who walks around the circumference of the island three times a day. Medea conquers him for you, casting a spell that makes him graze his ankle on a rock and spill out his ichor, the fluid that animates him. You and the Argonauts then spend the night here and create an altar to Athena in the morning. You then set sail for Anaphe.@172_321@-1@8_21@stop_default.jpg@“The Argonauts landing at the Tomb of Dolops” / Source Ye gods and little fishes, 1900.

28@City@136@Look for a way to Anaphe! Head north to that bare island they call Anaphe, watching for the nearby tiny isle of Hippouris.@Message@You were lost in the dark at sea until Apollo leaped down from heaven onto the island’s rocks, and held up his gleaming golden bow. That flashing light led you here, so you name the place ‘Anaphe’, ‘The Island of Revealing’. You want to make a thank offering to Apollo but have nothing but at this point have little more than water to pour as libations. Medea’s maidens, accustomed to the finery of the palace in Colchis, find this enormously amusing. They mock you, you and the men mock them back: comic relief! After some rest, you and your crew set sail for Aegina.@237@-1@-1@stop_default.jpg@“The Argonauts landing at the Tomb of Dolops” / Source Ye gods and little fishes, 1900.

29@City@126@Find a path to Aegina! Navagate northwest through a series of small islands to Aegina.@Message@While at sea, Euphemus dreams that the clod of dirt that had been given to him by Triton turned into a lovely maiden. You, Jason, recognize what this means, and convince him to throw the clod into the sea. Up rises the island of Calliste rises up from the very place the dirt entered the water. You then dock on the shores of Aegina and rest in order that you arrive at Pagasae on the next day!@-1@-1@-1@stop_default.jpg@“The Argonauts landing at the Tomb of Dolops” / Source Ye gods and little fishes, 1900.

30@City@309@It's time to go home! Return to Pagasse! You will need to skirt the land of Euboea to reach again Pagasae.@Message@You have arrived at Pagasae. You are very weary from many days of travel, but are happy to have finally completed your quest!@221@-1@-1@stop_default.jpg@“The Argonauts landing at the Tomb of Dolops” / Source Ye gods and little fishes, 1900.
