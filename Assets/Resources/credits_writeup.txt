Current Team:

Dr. Sandra Blakely – Project Director, Emory University, Department of Classics

Sandra Blakely is an Associate Professor of Classics at Emory University, where her research integrates anthropological, archaeological and Classical approaches to Greek religion and myth.  Her foci include mystery cults, the fragmentary Greek historians Herodoros, Conon and Alexander Polyhistor, and the daimones associated with metallurgy as well as with the Samothracian rites.  In her current book project, The Anthropology of an Island Cult: Maritime Networks and the cult of the Great Gods of Samothrace, she brings Social Network Analysis and Geographic Information Systems to the epigraphic record of the Great Gods of Samothrace, to test the hypothesis that the safety at sea the Samothracian rites promised was a social reality as well as a mythic metaphor.

Dr. Joanna C. Mundy – Digital Projects Specialist, Emory Center for Digital Scholarship

Joanna Mundy is a Digital Projects Specialist in the Emory Center for Digital Scholarship. She received her PhD from Emory University in Art History, 2018. For her dissertation she explored the built domestic environment in ancient urban houses, domūs and insulae, in the city of Rome in the first to fifth century CE and includes a social network analysis of households in the fourth century city. Her work for Samothracian Networks includes mySQL database design, so that the project database interacts with geospatial and network data. She works with network analysis software, produces network visualizations, and manages the website.

Student Participants:

Donovan Fain – Game Design and Programming, Kennesaw State University (2020-)

Donovan Fain is a senior (2020) at Kennesaw State University completing a degree in game design. He has worked on Sailing with the Gods, programming the storm mini-game in Spring 2020. He has continued to work as a consultant on the game over the summer, working on the port interactions, and other programming needs. You can find out more about Donovan on his website: https://donovanpanian.wixsite.com/donovanfainportfolio.


Kylie Gilde – User Interface and Game Designer, Kennesaw State University (2020-)

Kylie Gilde graduated from Kennesaw State University in 2020 with a degree in game design. She worked in Spring 2020 as a student on the user interfaces for the pirate and storm mini-games. After graduation she has worked as a consultant on the project on user interface design for the port menu and tax collector scenes. You can see more of her work on her website at  https://gamesbykylie.weebly.com/ or download some of her games at https://games-by-kylie.itch.io/.


Phoebe Han – Game Illustrator, Emory University (2020-)

Phoebe Han is a Visual Arts student, in an Art History and Integrated Visual Arts co-major (IVAC), at Emory University. She joined the Sailing with the Gods team in 2020, contributing illustrations that she designs of figures and scenes to the game.

Olivia Te Kolste - SIRE student and 3D modeler, Emory University (2020-)

Olivia Te Kolste is an undergraduate at Emory University, working on the Sailing with the Gods project through Emory's SIRE program for 2020-2021. Olivia will be working on developing historically informed 3D models of environments and mythical elements for the game.

Timmy Hawkins - Game Design and Programming, Kennesaw State University (2020)

Timmy Hawkins also graduated from Kennesaw State University in 2020 with a degree in game design. He worked in Spring 2020 on the development of the pirate mini-game code. This turn-based card game allows players to battle pirates who attack as they sail the Mediterranean.

Joe Fritsch – Digital Scholarship Associate, Emory Center for Digital Scholarship (2019-2020)

In his research Joe Fritsch, PhD candidate in English, focuses on the intersection of global Anglophone poetry and histories of technology. He supports Samothracian Networks in 3D modelling for the Game. His interest in CAD and 3D design comes from first hand witness of the importance of space to literacy while managing ILS databases in a New York pubic library; he recently used CAD software to recreate the floor plan of the Globe Theatre in order to teach students about Shakespeare’s London and digital methods.


Leigh Cole Furrh – BA in Classics, Emory University; MA in Archaeology, University of Toronto (2016-2018)

Leigh (Cole) Furrh completed his BA in Classics at Emory and his MA in Archaeology at the University of Toronto. He researches, prepares, and enters data from multiple Argonautica sources both for the Game and the Social Network. He is a 2016 Jane C. Waldbaum Archaeological Field School Scholarship recipient.


Alex Jester – Research Assistant, Agnes Scott College (2016-2018)

Alex Jester is pursuing a B.A. in Classical Languages and Literatures at Agnes Scott College, where she also works at Information Technology Services. She is especially interested in the intersection of Classics and technology, and plans to pursue a career that incorporates this overlap. She researches numismatic data for Samothracian Networks.


Emeritus Team:


Robert C. Bryant – Lead Programmer and Simulation Designer, University of Pennsylvania

Robert Bryant was the Lead Programmer and Simulation Designer behind the Samothracian Networks game Sailing with the Gods: Argonauts and Samothracians in an Ancient Sea. He completed his Master’s degree in Computer Science at Georgia State University, and has worked on projects from 3D Atlanta to the ongoing archaeological field research in Oglangala, Azerbaijan (Naxçivan). His work on the gamification of the Great Gods of Samothrace is one among many contributions to gaming, history and digital design. He’s currently the Programmer for the UPenn Museum TARA project, and a PhD Student in the UPenn Anthropology department.
